They can be installed by glueing, screwing or riveting onto existing structures. As they weight considerably less than conventional panels and are flexible, they are easier to transport, hoist onto roofs and  require less hazard work insurance as workmen donâ€™t deal with glass panels. Also there is no need for grounding or earthing since no metal parts." img={money.src} />

Also no metal framing around the panel, and less heat build up reduces the PIDs effect in SEDI PV Modules. Lower degradation implies longer product (25yrs) and linear performance warranties (40 yrs)." img={chart.src} />
